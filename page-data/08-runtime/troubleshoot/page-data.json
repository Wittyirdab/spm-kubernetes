You might see errors like the following:\n\n* `Get https://minikube.local:5000/v2/: http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client`\n* `Get http://minikube.local:5000/v2/: dial tcp 192.168.39.112:5000: connect: no route to host`\n\nThe errors can occur if the registry is not properly configured.  Some ways to investigate the errors are as follows:\n\nEnsure that the IP reflected by the `minikube ip` command is specified in the following locations:\n\n* `/etc/hosts` - Ensure that there is a `minikube.local` entry that matches the Minikube IP address. If necessary, modify the file.\n* `/etc/docker/daemon.json` -  Ensure that the specified subnet matches the Minikube IP address. If necessary, edit the file and restart the Docker service. You must also restart ChartMuseum.\n* `minikube start` command `--insecure-registry` option - When you use this command, ensure that the specified subnet matches the Minikube IP.\n\nConfirm the registry with the following command:\n\n`curl http://minikube.local:5000/v2/_catalog`\n\nThe command should return the following result:\n\n```json\n{\"repositories\":[\"batch\",\"curam\",\"httpd\",\"utilities\",\"xmlserver\"]}\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** An empty repository returns: `{\"repositories\":[]}`\n\n</InlineNotification>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"066b31a8f07fe62c6e166f2a88fa6c0a","counter":154,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Troubleshooting problems","description":"Troubleshooting problems"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Troubleshooting problems\ndescription: Troubleshooting problems\n---\n## Log collection\n\nTo copy logs from container to the host, enter the following command:\n\n```shell\ndocker cp <containerId>:/file/path/within/container /host/path/target\n```\n\nIf you want to navigate the Docker® container to find log files, enter the following command:\n\n```shell\ndocker exec -it [container-id] bash\n```\n\n## IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\nIntermittently, an issue can occur with a multi replica deployment utilising IBM [Cloud Object Storage](/07-supporting-infrastructure/COS).\nA race condition manifests leaving the pods unable to connect to or create folders in COS.\nA workaround to this issue is to deploy with an initial single replica to ensure that the COS directory structure is initialised correctly.\nThis can then be scaled up to the desired number of replicas.\n\n## Errors in the Docker registry\n\nThe Docker registry can be a source of errors, which might occur when you run `docker push` commands.
